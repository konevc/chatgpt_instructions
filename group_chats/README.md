# Instructions for group chats in ChatGPT

## How it works:
 1. Add a new chat in ChatGPT, and then click "Start a group chat" icon in the top right corner.
 2. Copy the group chat link to share with your friends and colleagues
 3. Setup the group chat in "New chat group" dropdown in the top left corner:
  - Rename the group chat
  - Add the relevant instruction from this Github folder
  - Customize the instruction and Save it.
 4. Ask "@ChatGPT, tell me about the group chat". It makes ChatGPT to read the instruction and start following it.
